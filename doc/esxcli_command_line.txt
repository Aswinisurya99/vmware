#Check esxcli command 

which esxcli

esxcli esxcli command list

#Check hardware

1. View installed PCI devices

esxcli hardware pci list | more

2. Check the amount of memory and CPU installed on the ESXi server:

esxcli hardware memory get

esxcli hardware cpu list

3. Check hardware clock

esxcli hardware clock get

4. Check boot devices info

esxcli hardware bootdevice list


#
#System settings
#

1. Check the precise ESXi version and build number,
   including the number of installed updated and patches:

esxcli system version get

2. Check the hostname of an ESXi server:

esxcli system hostname get

3. Check the ESXi installation time:

esxcli system stats installtime get

4. Check the SNMP configuration:

esxcli system snmp get

5. Enter the ESXi host to the maintenance mode:

esxcli system maintenanceMode set --enable yes

Exit the maintenance mode:

6. esxcli system maintenanceMode set --enable no

After entering an ESXi host to the maintenance mode, you can shut down or reboot the host.

7. Power off an ESXi host:

esxcli system shutdown poweroff

8. The command for rebooting the host is similar:

esxcli system shutdown reboot

9. You can also set a delay and write a reason of rebooting the host to be saved in system logs:

esxcli system shutdown reboot -d 60 -r “Installing patches”

In this example, the delay is 60 seconds.

10. The custom message 
It can be used for hiding information about your ESXi host on the display connected to the ESXi host when a user is not logged in.
esxcli system welcomemsg set -m="Welcome to NAKIVO! Press F2"
Verify whether the welcome message is already set:

esxcli system welcomemsg get




#
# Network settings
#

1. Check the status of active network connections:

esxcli network ip connection list

2. View the list of installed network adapters:

esxcli network nic list

3. Display the information about network interfaces:

esxcli network ip interface list

4. Display the information about IP addresses of the network interfaces that are present on the server:

esxcli network ip interface ipv4 get

5. Display the network information for VMs:

esxcli network vm list

6. View the domain search settings:

esxcli network ip dns search list

7. View the DNS servers set in the network settings:

esxcli network ip dns server list

8. List virtual switches and port groups:

esxcli network vswitch standard list

9. Show statistics for the vmnic0 network interface:

esxcli network nic stats get -n vmnic0

10. Check the firewall status and rule settings:

esxcli network firewall get

esxcli network firewall ruleset list

Note: The default firewall policy is to drop traffic if the opposite rules are not set.

11. You can temporary disable the firewall on an ESXi host for troubleshooting:

esxcli network firewall set --enabled false

12. The firewall must be enabled with the command:

esxcli network firewall set --enabled true




#
# Storage
#

1. Check the information about mounted VMFS volumes:

esxcli storage vmfs extent list

2. View mappings of VMFS file systems to disk devices:

esxcli storage filesystem list

3. List all the iSCSI paths on the system:

esxcli storage core path list

4. Display the list of mounted NFS shares:

esxcli storage nfs list







#
# iSCSI
#

1. Show the list of available iSCSI adapters:

esxcli iscsi adapter list

2. Re-discover and re-scan iSCSI adapters:

esxcli iscsi adapter discovery rediscover -A adapter_name

esxcli storage core adapter rescan -A adapter_name

Instead of -A adapter_name you can rescan all adapters by using the --all option





#
# Software
#

You can view the list of VIB packages installed on your ESXi host:

esxcli software vib list

You can install a VIB with ESXCLI (the ESXi host must be in maintenance mode):

esxcli software vib install -d /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/patches/patch_name.zip



#
# Managing users on an ESXi host from CLI 
#

1.) Add user kb with description systemadmin
[root@localhost:~] esxcli system account add -d "systemadmin" -i kb -p -c
Enter value for 'password':
Enter value for 'password-confirmation':

 2.) List newly created users:
[root@localhost:~] esxcli system account list

3.) List permissions:
[root@localhost:~] esxcli system permission list

 4.) Assign new permissions to newly created user kb:
[root@localhost:~] esxcli system permission set -i kb -r Admin

6.) Remove the account
[root@esxi01:~] esxcli system account remove -i kb








#
# VM operations
#

1. Check the list of running VMs and display their World IDs:

esxcli vm process list

2. Shutdown the VM
by using the World ID displayed in the output of the esxcli vm process list command. 
In the current example, the World ID of the necessary VM is 75498.

esxcli vm process kill -w 75498 -t soft

If the soft command type was not helpful, 
consider performing an immediate shutdown of the VM by using the hard method.

esxcli vm process kill -w 75498 -t hard

There are three available command options for the kill command:

soft - a correct signal is sent in the guest operating system to shut down a VM correctly;
hard - a VM is shut down immediately;
force - VM is powered off similarly to how a computer is powered off when unplugging the power cable. Only use this type of powering off the VM if the previous two types were unsuccessful.
